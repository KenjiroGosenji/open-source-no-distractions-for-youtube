**UPDATE**: I have rebuilt the Safari Extension to be compatible with iPad and iPhone as well. The app is now called 'Hide distractions on YouTube' and you can find it [on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1598123949). 

(The reason is that Apple changed something about how bundle identifiers are assigned, which made it needlessly complicated to convert the old app into a universal app compatible with iPad and iPhone...! \*sigh\*)

The GitHub repository for the new app is here: https://github.com/ulyngs/hide-distractions-on-youtube-universal

### What's New in This Version
Hi folks, the app is updated with a tweak suggested by a reviewer: the app now also hides video recommendations that YouTube pops up on the screen after a video ends.

Remember the extension is open source - find the source code and submit feature suggestions on https://github.com/ulyngs/open-source-no-distractions-for-youtube!


### Promotional text
Need to search for something on YouTube but get distracted by all the recommended videos? Use "No Distractions" for YouTube to hide the distractions and stay on task!

### Description
"No Distractions" for YouTube is a Safari App Extension I built to help myself. It lets you take control over what you need to find on YouTube instead of letting the YouTube algorithms control you...!

It does this by removing video recommendations on the front page as well as the 'up next' videos that usually appear on the right while you watch a video. Sleek and minimalistic!

You can still find what you need, but now you must actively search for it, so you can stay in control.

The app does not collect any data and does not send any data anywhere.

It is also open source, so you can inspect the code for yourself (or download it and make tweaks to it) here: https://github.com/ulyngs/open-source-no-distractions-for-youtube
